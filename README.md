# Revolutionizing-Brain-Tumour-Detection-GAN-Enhanced-MRI-Image-Synthesis-for-Advanced-Medical-Imaging
GAN for MRI image synthesis in brain tumor detection. Generator creates synthetic images from noise, discriminator distinguishes real/synthetic. Train both networks to minimize discrepancy. Clone repo, adjust hyperparams, prepare MRI dataset, and run training script.
